# Density LIME

In this project, we propose a better sampling strategy for generating explanations.
In particular, we propose to sample images that are more likely to live on the
manifold of the real data distribution.

## Project structure

```
src:
	lime: 			# copy of original lime implementation
	density-lime: 		# Extensions and modifications of lime implementations
